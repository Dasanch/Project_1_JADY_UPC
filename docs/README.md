# Description of the game
Last Resort is an arcade shoot 'em up video game by SNK released in 1992. It was also released for the Neo-Geo and Neo Geo CD systems, as well as SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 for the PS2, PSP, and Wii. Its gameplay was heavily inspired by R-Type and its system of pod attached to the player's ship.

The object of the game is to fight through five stages and destroy the end stage bosses by aiming for their weak points. The player maneuvers both a cyber jet and (once procured) an indestructible robot drone which acts as both as a shield against small projectiles (similar to the Dino 246 drone in Pulstar and Blazing Star) and an additional weapon with multi-directional fire and concussion launch capabilities. The robot drone can be toggled to a stoptrack position or to rotate around the cyber jet. The cyber jet can be upgraded with three levels of three types of firepower and faster jet speed by collecting the corresponding powerups.
